# Codebase Time Machine

[


## Building an Executable

To create a standalone executable that doesn't require Python to be installed:

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build_executable.sh

# Run the build script
./build_executable.sh
```

### Windows:
```
build_executable.bat
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` directory and can be distributed without requiring Python installation.



## Docker Deployment

This project includes Docker support for easy deployment and isolation.

### Building the Docker Image

#### Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x docker_build.sh

# Build the Docker image
./docker_build.sh
```

#### Windows:
```
docker_build.bat
```

### Running the Docker Container

#### Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Make the run script executable
chmod +x docker_run.sh

# Run the Docker container
./docker_run.sh
```

#### Windows:
```
docker_run.bat
```

### Docker Compose (for Web Applications)

If this is a web application, you can use Docker Compose for easier deployment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the application in detached mode.

If this is a web application, you can use Docker Compose for easier deployment:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the application in detached mode.



## Building an Executable

To create a standalone executable that doesn't require Python to be installed:

### Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build_executable.sh

# Run the build script
./build_executable.sh
```

### Windows:
```
build_executable.bat
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` directory and can be distributed without requiring Python installation.



## Docker Deployment

This project includes Docker support for easy deployment and isolation.

### Building the Docker Image

#### Linux/Mac:
```bash
# Make the build script executable
chmod +x docker_build.sh
