Task: Integration test for: Code Ownership Analysis Module

                                      'lines_added', and 'lines_deleted' keys.
                                      Example: [{'author': 'dev1', 'lines_added': 10, 'lines_deleted': 2}]

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are author names and values are another
              dictionary containing the total 'lines_changed' and the
              'commit_count' (author frequency).
