Task: Implement aggregation logic to calculate lines changed per author over time

Output:
def aggregate_lines_changed_per_author(commits_data):
    """
    Aggregates lines changed per author over time from commit data.

    This function processes a list of commit-like dictionaries, each
    containing author, date, and line change information. It returns a
    nested dictionary summarizing the total lines changed (added + deleted)
    for each author on each specific date.

    Args:
        commits_data (list[dict]): A list of dictionaries, where each
                                   dictionary represents a commit. Expected keys
                                   are 'author', 'date', 'lines_added', and
                                   'lines_deleted'.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are author names. Each value is another
              dictionary where keys are dates and values are the integer total
              of lines changed for that author on that date.
              Example: {'author1': {'2023-10-27': 150, '2023-10-28': 75}}

        date = commit.get('date')
        lines_added = commit.get('lines_added', 0)
        lines_deleted = commit.get('lines_deleted', 0)

        if not author or not date:
