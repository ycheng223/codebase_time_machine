Task: Implement cloning logic using a git library (e.g., GitPython) or subprocess

Output:
import git
import os

def clone_repository(repo_url: str, destination_path: str | None = None, branch: str | None = None) -> str:
    """
    Clones a remote Git repository to a specified local path using GitPython.

    Args:
        repo_url: The URL of the Git repository to clone.
        destination_path: The local path where the repository should be cloned.
                          If None, a directory with the repository's name is
                          created in the current working directory.
        branch: The specific branch to clone. If None, the default branch is cloned.

    Returns:
        The absolute path to the cloned repository's working directory.

    Raises:
        git.exc.GitCommandError: If the git clone command fails for any reason
                                 (e.g., authentication error, repository not found,
