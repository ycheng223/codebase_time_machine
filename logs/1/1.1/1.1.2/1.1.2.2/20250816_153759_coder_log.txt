    Creates a generator to iterate through all commits from HEAD backwards.

    This function opens a Git repository at the specified path and yields
    each commit object, starting from the current HEAD and traversing
    the commit history.

    Args:
        repo_path (str): The path to the git repository. Defaults to the
                         current working directory.

    Yields:
        git.Commit: The next commit object in the history.
    
    Raises:
        git.exc.InvalidGitRepositoryError: If the given path is not a valid
                                           git repository.
        git.exc.NoSuchPathError: If the given path does not exist.

    # repo.iter_commits() starts from the given revision (or HEAD by default)
    # and walks backwards through the parent commits.
    for commit in repo.iter_commits('HEAD'):
